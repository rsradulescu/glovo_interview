## Process for Data Analyst position
Author: Rocio Radulescu 

## SQL
I make the SQL process with PostgreSQL and Pgadmin
There are 3 scripts
- sql_1_createtables: import 2 tables from CSV in tables folder
- sql_2_querys: resolve A, createing 2 views and making query
- sql_3_querys: resolve B, with a function and a query.

I try to solve it in a scalable way, so functions and views can be reused in other queries.

## Business case
I develop this section in Google Colabority, with Python, like a notebook that you can see in

Thanks for your time 👋
